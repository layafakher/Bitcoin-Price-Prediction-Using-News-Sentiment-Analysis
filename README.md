## Abstract

> With the advancement and proliferation of technology, various news sources through news 
websites and different social media networks rapidly disseminate news across the globe. For 
this reason, many researchers and scholars take into account the influence of news 
sentiments when predicting human behavior in a particular field. Digital currencies are not 
exempt from this influence, and it has been observed that their prices, like many other 
financial markets, are subject to change based on news. Nevertheless, collecting news related 
to digital currencies such as Bitcoin and analyzing their sentiments, as well as predicting the 
price of this currency based on past prices and the impact of news on public sentiment, is a 
challenging task that has become manageable today with the assistance of machine learning 
 .algorithms and deep learning neural networks
In this project, an attempt has been made to collect news related to the digital currency 
market within a specified time frame and analyze their sentiments. Then, data related to the 
Bitcoin price within the same time frame is collected hourly through an API and combined 
with the information obtained from the sentiment analysis of the news. Finally, a model is 
designed to be trained on this dataset and be able to predict the price of Bitcoin for the next 
hour.
